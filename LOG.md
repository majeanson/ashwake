# LOG.md — the per-session record

One written question per session, answered after the work. Ashwake 1's
`LOG.md` (69 sessions, in `../tiles`) is the history of the rules; this file
starts at Session 1 for the body.

### Session 1 — the core is a package, and the rules did not move (2026-08-28)

**Question:** can Ashwake 1's DOM-free half be lifted into a package without
editing a rule?

**Answer: yes.** Everything ESLint already forbade the DOM — `engine`,
`content`, `meta`, `sim`, `render/layout.ts`, the `BoardView` contract,
`view.ts`, the lessons registry with `figure.ts` and `tips.ts`, and the theme
data with its budgets — was copied verbatim with every test, and the harness
in this repo prints byte for byte what the harness in `tiles@42d4da3` prints.
That output is `packages/core/sim.golden.txt` and CI diffs against it on every
push, so "same rules" is now a fact the build checks rather than a sentence.

**Two edits, both findings.**

1. `labelFor` — the rule that FAINT MEANS SPENT, with its 2026-08-27 story in
   `labels.test.ts` — lived inside `PixiRenderer.ts`, a file that cannot come
   along. It is `render/labels.ts` now. The extraction is the argument: a rule
   about what a star means was filed under a rendering library, and a 3D board
   would have had to re-derive it or disagree.
2. `scripts/sim.ts`'s four relative imports, because the file moved one
   directory.

**What did not come.** `theme/apply.ts` (sets CSS variables on `document`),
`render/PixiRenderer.ts`, `bake.ts`, `surfaces.ts`, `shareCard.ts`, all of
`ui/game.ts`, `shop`, `dialog`, `audio`, all of `shell/`, `style.css`,
`index.html`, and their 5,954 lines of DOM-coupled tests — the surface the
plan says gets rebuilt, not ported. 898 tests in Ashwake 1 became 646 here; the
252 that stayed behind are all pinned to markup this repo does not have.

**The scaffold.** A pnpm workspace with one vitest runner, one alias set
(`tsconfig.base.json`), and the layering lint ported across the package
boundary — the core may not import React, three, the app or the DOM, and the
app may not import the core by path. `apps/game` boots, reaches the core
through the aliases and prints the opening board's cell count; that is all it
does, on purpose.

**Verified:** 646 tests / 37 files; typecheck, lint, format and build clean;
`pnpm sim` identical to Ashwake 1's, 25 lines, 18 policies, 0 stalled, 0
capped. **Nothing playable; nothing seen on a phone.**

**Next:** S2 — the 3D board. Open before it: does the camera tilt (Marc,
with screenshots).

### Session 2 — the core speaks two languages, and English did not move (2026-08-28)

**Question:** can every sentence a player reads move into a catalogue without
a single English string changing — and can French be a first language rather
than a translation layer?

**Answer: yes, and the proof is procedural.** Fifteen snapshots were recorded
BEFORE the move (`teaching.pin.test.ts` already had six; `prose.pin.test.ts`
added nine for the receipts, the tap-a-hex answers, the epitaph pools, the
guide/hint lines, the purse card, the figure captions and the small labels in
`meta/` and `content/`). After the move, every one of those fifteen English
bodies is byte-identical to its new `· en` block — checked key by key against
the pre-move commit, twice, once after the French landed. The golden sim diff
stayed empty throughout.

**The shape.** `text/Strings.ts` is the type: one object per language, every
sentence a string or a function of its facts. The rule that makes two
languages safe is that **the catalogue never decides**: `lessons.ts` keeps
the dial conditions and reads `s.lesson.ripe.stoneAsh(name)`; `view.ts`
computes worth, multipliers and counts and hands them to `s.view.pocket.score`;
`PERKS`, `UPGRADES`, `GOALS`, `UNLOCKS`, `SHED_LADDER` and `FEATURES` keep ids
and numbers and hand back words through `perkText`, `upgradeText`,
`unlockLabel`, `shedNote`, `featureText`. Theme names and notes are per
locale; `namesOf(theme, locale)` is the one accessor. `pickLocale` is pure and
lives in `content/` so both `theme` and `text` can see the `Locale` type
without a cycle.

**Four findings the second language surfaced.**

1. **The core was not DOM-free.** `view/tips.ts` and `view/figure.ts` called
   `document.createElement`; the determinism lint only watched `engine/` and
   `content/`. Their element builders are gone (a React `TipRows` and `Figure`
   replace them in Stage 3), `figureLayout` keeps the geometry pure, and the
   DOM ban covers all of `packages/core` now. `meta/report.ts`'s injectable
   `fetch` default is the one exemption, marked for Stage 4.
2. **`\b` is ASCII.** The term matcher would never have found `RÉSERVE`; it
   uses `(?<![\p{L}\p{N}])…(?![\p{L}\p{N}])` with the `u` flag now, and a
   new invariant says every term occurs in its own lesson — which is what
   catches an accent dropped in a term but kept in the prose.
3. **Québec is not France.** The plan said a fine space before `:` `;` `!`
   `?` `%`; the OQLF's Québec usage is `:` and `%` only. The test says so and
   the French follows it.
4. **Plurals and ordinals are facts of a language.** `ordinal` moved from
   `daily.ts` to `text/format.ts` with a locale; French counts `1er`, `2e`;
   0 and 1 are singular in French, so the catalogue has its own `pl`.

**The French.** ≈250 sentences in Québec French under Marc's glossary (D4):
tutoiement, names as headings never as nouns with articles, `’` throughout,
accents on capitals, `12 345` from five digits. Recorded once into the
snapshot files as the review surface. **Not yet read by Marc.**

**Verified:** 693 tests / 40 files (646 → 693: the French blocks, the
typography and format tests, `pickLocale`); typecheck, lint, format, build
green; golden sim identical; CI green.

**Next:** Marc reads the French; S2 — the 3D board.
